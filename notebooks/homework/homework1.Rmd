1. Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know the average (mean) amount of money 
spent on school uniforms each year by families with children at Whitewater Academy. We randomly survey 100 families 
with children in the school. Three of the families spent $65, $75, and $95, respectively.

- **Population**: The set of all families with children attending Whitewater Academy.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population, which is 100 randomly selected families.
- **Parameter of Interest**: The **average (mean) amount of money** spent on school uniforms each year by all families 
with children at Whitewater Academy.
- **Statistic**: The **sample mean amount spent on uniforms** by the 100 randomly surveyed families.
- **Data**: The set of values representing individual amounts spent by surveyed families, such as $65, $75, and $95.
- **Variable**: The amount of money spent on school uniforms per year by a family (a **quantitative** variable).

2. Determine what the key terms refer to in the following study. Cars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into 
a wall at a speed of 35 miles per hour. We want to know the proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat that would have 
had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers. We start with a simple random sample of 75 cars.

- **Population**: The set of all cars (with dummies in the front seats) that could be crashed into a wall at 35 mph.
- **Sample**: The subset of 75 randomly selected cars used in the study.
- **Parameter of Interest**: The **proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat that would have had head injuries** if 
they had been actual drivers, across all possible crashes.
- **Statistic**: The **proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat that experienced head injuries** in the sample of 
75 cars.
- **Data**: The individual results from the 75 crashes, indicating whether each driver-seat dummy sustained a head 
injury (**yes/no**, categorical data).
-**Variable**: Whether a **driver-seat dummy sustains a head injury** (**qualitative, binary categorical** variable: 
"yes" or "no").

3. The data are the number of machines in a gym. You sample five gyms. One gym has 12 machines, one gym has 15 machines, 
one gym has ten machines, one gym has 22 machines, and the other gym has 20 machines. What type of data is this?

- **Type of Data**: **Quantitative** (Numerical)  
- **Discrete or Continuous?**: **Discrete**; because the number of machines is a countable whole number and cannot take 
fractional values.

4. You go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (19 ounces tomato soup, 14.1 ounces lentil soup and 19 
ounces of Italian wedding), two packages of nuts (walnuts and peanuts), four different kinds of vegetable (broccoli, 
cauliflower, spinach and carrots), and two desserts (16 ounces pistachio ice cream and 32 ounces of chocolate cookies). 
Name data set that are quantitative discrete, quantitative continuous and qualitative.

- **Quantitative Discrete Data** (Countable numerical values):
  - **Number of soup cans** (3)
  - **Number of nut packages** (2)
  - **Number of vegetable types** (4)
  - **Number of dessert items** (2)
- **Quantitative Continuous Data** (Measurements that can take any value within a range):
  - **Weight of tomato soup** (19 ounces)
  - **Weight of lentil soup** (14.1 ounces)
  - **Weight of Italian wedding soup** (19 ounces)
  - **Weight of pistachio ice cream** (16 ounces)
  - **Weight of chocolate cookies** (32 ounces)
- **Qualitative Data** (Categorical variables that describe characteristics):
  - **Types of soup** (Tomato, Lentil, Italian Wedding)
  - **Types of nuts** (Walnuts, Peanuts)
  - **Types of vegetables** (Broccoli, Cauliflower, Spinach, Carrots)
  - **Types of desserts** (Pistachio Ice Cream, Chocolate Cookies)
